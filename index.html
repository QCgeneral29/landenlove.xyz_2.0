            <h3 style="display: inline;">Rogue Virus</h3><p style="display: inline;">, <i>Unity</i>, <i>C#</i>, <i>Java</i></p>
            <p>Rogue Virus was a senior inquiry project at Augustana college for CSC-490. It is a
player-versus-player rogue-like. This means that dungeons are randomly generated by
a given seed. In order to win, one player must achieve a higher score than the other
player. If both players share the same score, the one with the fastest time wins. Utilized
a game server programmed in Java running on a Google Cloud virtual machine.

            <!-- Second Project -->
            <h3 style="display: inline;">Smart Car</h3><p style="display: inline;">, <i>Java</i>, <i>Eclipse</i>, <i>JavaFX</i></p>
            <p>This project was created for the software development course CSC-305 at Augustana
college. The goal was to create a 2D game where the player controls a car on an infinitely
scrolling highway. The player's score is based on how long they stay alive. The player
must dodge other motorists to avoid taking damage. Programmed in Java using the
JavaFX library. The game is sprite based and uses object oriented programming.
