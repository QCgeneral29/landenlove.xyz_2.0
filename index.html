            <h3 style="display: inline;">Rogue Virus</h3><p style="display: inline;">, <i>Unity</i>, <i>C#</i>, <i>Java</i></p>
            <p>As part of my senior inquiry project at Augustana College, I developed "Rogue Virus," a player-versus-player rogue-like game with randomly generated dungeons. The objective of the game is to achieve a higher score than your opponent, or if both players have the same score, the one with the fastest time wins. I utilized a game server programmed in Java, which was hosted on a Google Cloud virtual machine. You can view the project on GitHub at the following link: <a href="https://git.io/JMrxg" target="_blank">https://git.io/JMrxg</a>.</p>

            <p>As part of the CSC-305 software development course at Augustana College, I developed "Smart Car," a 2D video game in which players control a car on an endlessly scrolling highway and score points by staying alive as long as possible. To survive, players must avoid collisions with other vehicles on the road. I implemented the game using Java and the JavaFX library, utilizing sprite-based graphics and object-oriented programming principles. The project is available for review on GitHub at the following link: <a href="https://git.io/JMoJn" target="_blank">https://git.io/JMoJn</a>.</p>
